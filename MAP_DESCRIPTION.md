For this project I have chosen to download the data corresponding to the city of A Coruña, Spain:
 - Link: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/346810
 - Latitude range: 43.2992º to 43.4080º
 - Longitude range: -8.4737º to -8.3330º

The motivation behind this is that this is my hometown and, therefore, I am interested to see the degree of representativeness of the OpenStreetMap data and help its improvement if needed.
